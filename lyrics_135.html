Translation:
(1) I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis,namely Sri Rupa Gosvami, Sri Sanatana Gosvami,
Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, SriJiva Gosvami, and Sri Gopala Bhatta
Gosvami, who are always engaged in chanting the holy name ofKrishna and dancing. They are just like the ocean
of love of God, and they are popular both with the gentle and withthe ruffians, because they are not envious
of anyone. Whatever they do, they are all-pleasing to everyone, andthey are fully blessed by Lord Caitanya.
Thus they are engaged in missionary activities meant to deliver allthe conditioned souls in the material universe.
(2) I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis,namely Sri Rupa Gosvami, Sri Sanatana Gosvami,
Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, SriJiva Gosvami, and Sri Gopala Bhatta
Gosvami, who are very expert in scrutinizingly studying all therevealed scriptures with the aim of
establishing eternal religious principles for the benefit of allhuman beings. Thus they are honored all over
the three worlds and they are worth taking shelter of because theyare absorbed in the mood of the gopis and
are engaged in the transcendental loving service of Radha andKrishna.
(3) I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis,namely Sri Rupa Gosvami, Sri Sanatana Gosvami,
Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, SriJiva Gosvami, and Sri Gopala Bhatta
Gosvami, who are very much enriched in understanding of LordCaitanya and who are thus expert in
narrating His transcendental qualities. They can purify allconditioned souls from the reactions of their
sinful activities by pouring upon them transcendental songs aboutGovinda. As such, they are very expert
in increasing the limits of the ocean of transcendental bliss, andthey are the saviors of the living entities from
the devouring mouth of liberation.
(4) I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis,namely Sri Rupa Gosvami, Sri Sanatana Gosvami,
Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, SriJiva Gosvami, and Sri Gopala Bhatta
Gosvami, who kicked off all association of aristocracy asinsignificant. In order to deliver the poor
conditioned souls, they accepted loincloths, treating themselves asmendicants, but they are always merged in
the ecstatic ocean of the gopisâ€™ love for Krishna and bathe alwaysand repeatedly in the waves of that ocean.
(5) I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis,namely Sri Rupa Gosvami, Sri Sanatana Gosvami,
Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, SriJiva Gosvami, and Sri Gopala Bhatta
Gosvami, who were always engaged in worshiping Radha-Krishna in thetranscendental land of Vrindavana
where there are beautiful trees full of fruits and flowers whichhave under their roots all valuable jewels.
The Gosvamis are perfectly competent to bestow upon the livingentities the greatest boon of the goal of life.
(6) I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis,namely Sri Rupa Gosvami, Sri Sanatana Gosvami,
Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, SriJiva Gosvami, and Sri Gopala Bhatta
Gosvami, who were engaged in chanting the holy names of the Lordand bowing down in a
scheduled measurement. In this way they utilized their valuablelives and in executing these devotional
activities they conquered over eating and sleeping and were alwaysmeek and humble enchanted by
remembering the transcendental qualities of the Lord.
(7) I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis,namely Sri Rupa Gosvami, Sri Sanatana Gosvami,
Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, SriJiva Gosvami, and Sri Gopala Bhatta
Gosvami, who were sometimes on the bank of the Radha-kunda lake orthe shores of the Yamuna and
sometimes at Vamsivata. There they appeared just like madmen in thefull ecstasy of love for Krishna,
exhibiting different transcendental symptoms in their bodies, andthey were merged in the ecstasy of
Krishna consciousness.
(8) I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis,namely Sri Rupa Gosvami, Sri Sanatana Gosvami,
Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, SriJiva Gosvami, and Sri Gopala Bhatta
Gosvami, who were chanting very loudly everywhere in Vrindavana,shouting, "Queen of Vrindavana, Radharani!
O Lalita! O son of Nanda Maharaja! Where are you all now? Are youjust on the hill of Govardhana, or are
you under the trees on the bank of the Yamuna? Where are you?"These were their moods in executing
Krishna consciousness.

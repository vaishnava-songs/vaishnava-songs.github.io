TRANSLATION
1)O mind, I grasp your feet and beg you with sweet words:Please cast away all hypocrisy and develop intense, unprecedentedlove for my spiritual master, Vrajabhumi, the people of Vraja, theVaisnavas, the brahmanas, the Gayatri mantra, the holy name, andthe transcendental shelter that is the fresh young couple of Vraja,Radha and Krsna.
2)O Mind, don’t concern yourself with the pious and impiousdeeds described in the Vedas. Rather, intently serve Sri SriRadha-Krsna in Vraja. Always remember that Lord Caitanya is the sonof Maharaja Nanda and that my guru is most dear to LordMukunda.
3)O Mind, just listen to me! If you desire to reside inVraja birth after birth, and if you desire to directly serve thedivine youthful couple there with great attraction, then withintense love always remember and bow down to Srila Svarupa DamodaraGosvami; to Srila Rupa Gosvami and his elder brother, SrilaSanatana Gosvami; and to all their associates and followers.
4)O mind, give up friendship with nondevotees, which isnothing but a prostitute who will steal the treasure of yourheart–your desire to serve Radha-Krsna. Don’t listen to talks ofimpersonal liberation, which are a tigress who devours everyone.You should even give up attraction for Lord Narayana, which leadsto the world of Vaikuntha. Instead, O mind, just worship Sri SriRadha-Krsna in Vraja, for They bestow upon their worshipers thejewel of pure love for Themselves.
5)The highwaymen of lust and his friends have bound mearound the neck with the painful, horrible, powerful ropes of manywicked deeds. O mind, please scream out to the devotees of Krsna,the killer of Baka, "I am being killed!" Then He will save me.
6)O Mind, why do you burn us both by bathing in the urinetrickling from the ass of great deviousness and hypocrisy? Instead,you should delight us by eternally bathing in the glisteningnectar-ocean of pure love for Sri Sri Gandharva-Giridhari (Sri SriRadha-Krsna).
7)As long as the impudent untouchable woman of the desirefor fame dances in my heart, why should pure love for Radha-Krsnatouch me? O mind, continuously serve my spiritual master, theleader of those who are dear to the Lord. Then my master willquickly kick out that harridan and allow that pure love toenter.
8)So That He will mercifully smash my wickedness (eventhough I am a great rascal), so that He will give me the splendidnectar of transcendental love, and so He will engage me in SriRadha’s service, please, O mind, with words choked with emotion,worship Lord Giridhari here in Vraja.
9)O mind, please meditate on Krsna, the moon of Vrajaforest, as the Lord of my controller, Srimati Radharani. And pleasemeditate upon Srimati Radharani, the queen of Vraja forest, asKrsna’s controller. Also please meditate upon Lalita as thepeerless friend of Radha and Krsna, Visakha as the guru who teachesThem many things, and Radha-kunda and Govardhana Hill as two placesthe mere sight of which bestows charming transcendental love forthe divine couple.
10)O mind, please worship Lord Hari’s beloved Radha. withthe splendor of Her beauty She makes Rati, Gauri, and Lila burnwith envy, with the power of Her good fortune She defeats Saci,Laksmi, and Satyabhama, and with Her ability to control Krsna Shecompletely eclipses Candravali and the other pious young girls ofVraja.
11)O mind, in order to attain the direct service of the twodivine lovers, Sri Sri Radha-Giridhari, in the company of Theirfriends, every day you must constantly drink, with Sri RupaGosvami, the five nectars of worshiping Them, chanting Their names,meditating on Them, hearing about Them, and bowing down beforeThem, and every day you must worship Govardhana Hill.
12)These eleven excellent instructions to the mind grant allspiritual benedictions. A person who stays with the devotees,follows Srila Rupa Gosvami, and with a sweet voice loudly singsthese eleven verses will attain the matchless jewel of directservice to Sri Sri Radha-Krsna in the forest of Gokula.

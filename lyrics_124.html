Thakura Vaisnava Pada

Thakura VaisnavaPada:
(1)
thakura baisnaba-pada abanirasu-sampada
suna bhai hana ekamana
asraya laiya bhaje ta're krsnanahi tyaje
ara saba mareakarana
(2)
baisnaba-carana-jalaprema-bhaktidite bala
ara keha nahebalabanta
baisnaba-carana-renu mastakebhusana binu
ara nahi bhusaneraanta
(3)
tirtha-jala pabitra-gunalikhiyache purane
se saba bhaktiraprabancana
baisnabera padodaka sama nahe eisaba
jate haya banchitapurana
(4)
baisnaba-sangete mana ananditaanuksana
sada hayakrsna-para-sanga
dina narottama kande hiya dhairyanahi bandhe
mora dasa kena hailabhangarnaments; anta--another.

Translation:
1) O brother, please haer my words with rapt attantion. Thelotus feet of the Vaisnavas the most valuable treasure of thisworld. These Vaisnavas continually take shelter of Lord Krsna andworship Him, They never abandon their Lord. They are liberated.They are free from the cycle of birth and death.
2) The water which has washed the lotus feet of theVaisnavas bestows devotional service in pure love of God, and thereis nothing as effective for attaining this divine love. I place thedust from the lotus feet of the Vaisnavas upon my head. I wear noother ornament.
3) The purifying power of the waters at the various holyplaces of pilgrimage is described in the Puranas, although thisissomething of a deceptive trick. Actually there is not anything aspurifying as the water which has washed the lotus feet of theVaisnavas. This water fulfills all desires.
4) Moment after moment my mind finds constant pleasure inthe association of the Vaisnavas. I always seek out the company ofthose who are devoted to Lord Krsna. Poor-hearted Narottama dasabreaks down and cries. How has this fallen condition come uponme?

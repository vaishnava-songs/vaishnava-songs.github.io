TRANSLATION
1) O dear one who belongs to Vrndavana! O darling son of Nanda Maharaja! O prince of the cowherd
boys, kindly play again on Your flute so we may hear the melodies dear to all Your friends.
2) O Gopal, since You’ve left Vrndavana, the flowers have lost their desire to bloom. Still we decorate
the moonlit groves of Madhuvan, hoping You will return for Your amorous rendezvous.
3) Sridāma, Sudāma, and Your brother Balarāma are calling, “O Kanai! Please come back!” While
tending the calves and playing on their flutes they entreat, “O brother! Please come home!”
4) Mother Yasoda is crying out, “O Gopal! You are my life and soul! Please come home, O butter
thief!” Within the heart of Srimati Radharani, divine love for You flows like the Yamuna River.

Translation:
1) The beautiful darling son of mother Saci is dancing inthe kirtana of Lord Hari’s names. His forehead,
adorned with sandalwood tilaka, enchants everyone’s mind as Hisbeautiful locks of hair shine splendrously
as they bounce upon His cheeks.
2) His hair is wrapped in a topknot, and a garland of forestflowers sways upon His chest. Wearing brilliant
yellow silken garments, He dances as anklets tinkle pleasingly andrhythmically.
3) Sri Sri Radha and Krishna, Who dance together in thegroves of Nidhuvana with a flute, have combined as
one transcendental form. In this form, the Lord of Visvarupa hascome and manifested Himself in the town
of Nadiya.
4) Some in that spectacular performance sing the names ofRadha and Krishna, some glorify Lord Hari by
praising His transcendental qualities, while others play ferventlythe auspicious rhythms of the sweet
and relishable mridanga drums. All this takes place.

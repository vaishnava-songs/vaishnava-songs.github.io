TRANSLATION
1) On Ekadasi day Mahaprabhu, who is the life and soul ofall beings, decreed that every-one should
gather for kirtana. Hearing the sound of His own name, He began todance in ecstasy.
2) In Srivasa-angana, Srivasa Thakura’s divine courtyard, Heinaugurated the auspicious reverberations
of the kirtana in a booming voice: “Gopala! Govinda!”
3) In the courtyard the sounds of the mrdanga, smallcymbals, conch, karatalas and beautiful singing
all mixed together.
4) The loud sound passed through the entire brahmanda andfilled the whole sky reaching
Svetadvipa, destroying everything inauspicious in all the fourteenworlds.
5) From morning Visvambhara He who nourishes and maintainsthe whole universe by bhakti
started dancing. Many groups sang charmingly – each group singing adifferent melody.
6) Srivasa Pandita was the guru of one group of kirtaniyas,and Mukunda was the lead singer of another.
7) Govinda Ghosa was the head of another group. Gauracandradanced in the middle of the whole
kirtana party.
8) The mighty Nityananda Prabhu protected Mahaprabhu when Heswooned while dancing as
Advaita Acarya secretly took His foot-dust at that time.
9) Tears came to Gadadhara, Mukunda, Sridhara and othersupon hearing Mahaprabhu’s kirtana, as
the rising of asta-sattvika bhavas overwhelmed their hearts.
10) Visvambhara danced with so much force that the earthtrembled, causing all the devotees to
become afraid.
11) Sometimes Visvambhara danced so gracefully and sweetlythat He appeared to be natavara
Nanda-nandana, the best of dancers.
12) Mahaprabhu’s beauty is unequalled and unsurpassed;defeating even Krsna’s beauty even Krsna
has no mahabhava. All His followers’ eyes filled with ananda seeingHis dancing.
13) Mahaprabhu Visvambhara danced, absorbed in ananda.Hearing the rhythm of His dancing feet,
the devotees became spellbound.
14) As Mahaprabhu danced, being filled with bhava, Hisgarland could not stay around His neck but
broke, all the flowers falling at the feet of His devotees.
15) The auspicious sounds of sri harinama-sankirtana spreadin every direction while Jagannatha
Misra’s son danced in the midst of all the devotees.
16) Siva chants the same blissful name and becomes soabsorbed in prema that his cloth falls
down. Hearing Mahaprabhu’s glories, Siva starts to dance, andMahaprabhu, hearing His own glories,
also dances.
17) By this same nama Valmiki achieved the wealth ofausterity – he saw all Rama lila. And by this
same nama all of Ajamila’s anarthas and aparadhas were pulled outby the root.
18) Hearing sri krsna-nama totally cuts all worldlyattachments. Sri Krsna Himself came in Kali-yuga
as Mahaprabhu, dancing and advising all to chant krsna-nama.
19) Sukadeva and Narada also chant this krsna-nama anddistribute it. With thousands of
tongues Mahaprabhu sings the glories of this nama.
20) Taking Mahaprabhu’s name constitutes the highest form ofatonement. Seeing Mahaprabhu
dancing, the devotees became supremely fortunate.
21) Seeing Mahaprabhu’s bliss, the devotees embraced eachother and wept loudly as the rays
of Mahaprabhu’s ananda entered their hearts.
22) All the devotees attended kirtana and Mahaprabhupersonally decorated their bodies with candana
and garlands. Sri Gaurasundara and the devotees sang and tastedkrsnarasa with great joy.
23) Absorbed in kirtana, all the Vaisnava devoteescompletely lost sense of their own bodies and
everyone else around them.
24) “Jaya krsna, murari, mukunda, vanamali.” Day and nightall the devotees sang kirtana in
great happiness.
25) Visvambhara danced twenty-four hours with His devoteesbut never tired, because His body
was sattva-kalevara, fully transcendental.
26) Daily Mahaprabhu in full prema danced in kirtana thewhole night, and only stopped three
hours before sunrise.
27) Daily Mahaprabhu, the hero who enjoys the prema-rasa ofVaikuntha Svetadvipa, tasted
and distributed great bliss in Navadvipa.
28) Gauracandra and all His associates enter in the heartsof the devotees who hear the allvirtuous
hari-katha with full faith. Thus their hearts becomeSrivasa-angana.
29) Vrndavana dasa says, “Sri Krsna Caitanya and themoon-like Nityananda Prabhu are my life and
soul and I offer my dandavat-pranama at Their lotus feet.”

TRANSLATION
1) O Lost Mind You cannot find my Lord Nityananda as well asLord Gauranga. You have smeared
your whole body with tilak but still cannot find Gaura chaand.
2) How can you find the true love of Lord Gaura anywhere, ifyou are not properly situated internally
and externally. If your worship is not proper O my friend, then youwill not find that gold treasure of
pure love.
3) You have to first clean the dirty mind, only then willaffection for the names and glorification of
Lord will arise. With affection i applied tilak......but could notdo gaur bhajan..oh Lost mind !!
4) My merciful Nitai stays in the home of that person wholoves this eternal commodity of love. When
you call out with utmost devotion to that dear one of Lord, yourpath will be a success and not a failure

A. C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada

This song of Srila Narottama Dasa Thakura is very famous amongdevotees in Bengal and Orissa. When
Lord Caitanya returned from Gaya, where He was initiated by SriIsvara Puri, He was completely transformed
into a God-intoxicated personality whom His students of grammar hadnever known before. Instead of
teaching ordinary grammar studies, Lord Caitanya explained everysentence in such a way that every
Sanskrit word and every letter was understood to indicate Krishna,the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This
form of grammar was later on developed by Srila Jiva Gosvami in abook called Hari-namamrita-vyakarana,
The Grammar of the Nectar and Name of Sri Hari. But Lord Caitanya’sstudents thought that their teacher
had become mad, and they rubbed His head with Vishnu oil, an oilthat cools the brain. Finally they asked
Him, “You say that everything means Krishna and we shouldultimately always be chanting the names of Krishna.
Just how should we do this?” Then Lord Caitanya began to sing thenames of Krishna and clap His hands, and
He began His nama-sankirtana movement. The names He sang are thefirst two lines of this song, and
Narottama Dasa Thakura and others have placed these names in thebeginning of their writings to
immortalize these events in the memory of everyone.
Narottama Dasa Thakura chants the names of Lord Caitanya,Nityananda, Sri Advaita and Sita (Lord
Advaita’s consort). Since Lord Hari, the spiritual master, and theSrimad Bhagavad-gita are all on
the transcendental platform, they are given the same respect. ThenSrila Narottama Dasa chants the names of
the six Gosvamis. “I offer my obeisances at their feet,” he sings,“which destroy sufferings accumulated over
many long years. I am the servant of these six Gosvamis, and thedust of their lotus feet is my five kinds
of foodstuffs. To serve their lotus feet and keep the associationof devotees is my only business, birth after
birth.” When the six Gosvamis were staying at Vrindavana, theyrevealed the eternal transcendental pastimes of
Sri Sri Radha-Krishna. Before Lord Caitanya the exact location ofthe places of Lord Krishna’s pastimes were
not known, and therefore Lord Caitanya instructed the Gosvamis touncover the holy places and
construct temples. The temple of Sri Radha Damodara is situatednear the location of the rasa dance, and
Srila Rupa Gosvami and the other Gosvamis used to gather there anddiscuss the topics of their literatures,
which scientifically explained the super-excellent pastimes of SriSri Radha-Krishna. Narottama Dasa Thakura
says, “In great ecstasy shout the name of Hari and serve the realtranscendental master and devotees.”
He concludes by saying, “With all hopes in the lotus feet of myguru and the holy Vaishnavas, Narottama Dasa
sings the sankirtana of Lord Hari: Hare Krishna Hare KrishnaKrishna Krishna Hare Hare/Hare Rama Hare Rama
Rama Rama Hare Hare.”

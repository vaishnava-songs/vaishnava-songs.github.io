Translation:
1) O saintly Vaisnavas, although I am very fallen andmisbehaved, I nevertheless place this appeal before you:
My destiny has immersed me in this fearsome ocean of repeated birthand death. Please grab me by the hair,
and pull me to the opposite shore.
2) My destiny is very powerful. I am not able to hear theknowledge of spiritual life, and I am always bound
by the ropes of karma. I cannot see any way to escape my condition.I see only suffering. Helpless and
stricken with grief, I cry.
3) My blind mind cannot see what path is auspicious orinauspicious. My blind mind is helplessly dragged
from here to there by lust, anger, greed, bewilderment, madness,and pride.
4) My mind became immersed in the impermanent satisfactionof the senses, and I could not understand the
reals goal of life. For this reason I did not aspire to attain Yourlotus feet. Narottama dasa says--Now that I
am able to see, hear, and touch the Vaisnavas, I have become freeform all fear.

very part of my hair. Oh! With the sweet name of Radha.
2) Radha is there within my vision. Radha is there within myspeech. I interweave my every word. Oh!
With the sweet name of Radha.
3) Radha is there in my necklace. Radha is there in my sari.I have adorned my nose ring. Oh! With
the sweet name of Radha.
4) Radha is there in my walking. Radha is there in mygestures. My sash of waist-bells resounds. Oh!
With the sweet name of Radha.
5) Radha is there on my right and on my left. Radha is therein front of me and behind. My every
fiber reflects the rasa flowing. Oh! With the sweet name ofRadha.

plays His flute which calls out. Oh! With the sweet name ofRadha.

Hari He Doyala Mora

Hari He DoyalaMora
(1)
hari he dayala mora jaya radha-natha
bara bara e-i bara laha nijasatha
(2)
bahu yoni bhrami natha la-inu sarana
nija gune kripa karaadhama-tarana
(3)
jagata-tarana tumi jagata-jibana
toma chada kara nahi heradha-ramana
(4)
bhubana-mangala tumi bhubanera pati
tumi upekshile natha ki ha-ibegati
(5)
bhabiya dekhinu e-i jagata majhare
toma bina keha na-i e rameuddhare

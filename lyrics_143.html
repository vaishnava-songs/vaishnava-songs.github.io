Panca-tattva Maha-mantra
(jaya) sri-krishna-caitanya prabhunityananda
sri-advaita gadadharasrivasadi-gaura-bhakta-vrinda

Purport by
His Divine GraceA. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is always accompanied by His plenaryexpansion Sri Nityananda Prabhu, His
incarnation Sri Advaita Prabhu, His internal potency Sri GadadharaPrabhu, and His marginal potency
Srivasa Prabhu. He is in the midst of them as the SupremePersonality of Godhead. One should know that
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is always accompanied by these othertattvas. Therefore our obeisances to Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu are complete when we say, sri-krishna-caitanyaprabhu nityananda sri-advaita
gadadhara srivasadi-gaura-bhakta-vrinda. As preachers of theKrishna consciousness movement, we first offer
our obeisances to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu by chanting thisPanca-tattva mantra; then we say, Hare Krishna,
Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama,Rama Rama, Hare Hare. There are ten offenses in
the chanting of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra, but these are notconsidered in the chanting of the Pancatattva
mantra, namely, sri-krishna-caitanya prabhu nityananda sri-advaitagadadhara srivasadi-gaura-bhaktavrinda.
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is known as maha-vadanyavatara, the mostmagnanimous incarnation, for
He does not consider the offenses of the fallen souls. Thus toderive the full benefit of the chanting of the
maha-mantra (Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, HareHare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare
Hare), we must first take shelter of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, learnthe Panca-tattva mantra, and then chant
the Hare Krishna maha-mantra. That will be very effective.

Hare Krishna Maha-mantra
HARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE
HARE RAMA HARE RAMA RAMA RAMA HAREHARE

Purport by
His Divine GraceA. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada

The transcendental vibration established by the chanting of HareKrishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/
Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare is the sublime method ofreviving our Krishna consciousness.
As living spiritual souls we are all originally Krishna consciousentities, but due to our association with matter
from time immemorial, our consciousness is now polluted by thematerial atmosphere. The material
atmosphere, in which we are now living, is called maya, orillusion. Maya means "that which is not." And what
is this illusion? The illusion is that we are all trying to belords of material nature, while actually we are under
the grip of her stringent laws. When a servant artificially triesto imitate the all-powerful master, this is
called illusion. In this polluted concept of life, we are alltrying to exploit the resources of material nature,
but actually we are becoming more and more entangled in hercomplexities. Therefore, although we are
engaged in a hard struggle to conquer nature, we are ever moredependent on her. This illusory struggle
against material nature can be stopped at once by revival of ourKrishna consciousness.
Krishna consciousness is not an artificial imposition on the mind;this consciousness is the original energy of
the living entity. When we hear the transcendental vibration, thisconsciousness is revived. And this process
is recommended for this age by authorities. By practical experiencealso, one can perceive that by chanting
this maha-mantra, or the Great Chanting for Deliverance, one can atonce feel a transcendental ecstasy
coming through from the spiritual stratum. And when one isfactually on the plane of spiritual understanding
—surpassing the stages of senses, mind, and intelligence—one issituated on the transcendental plane.
This chanting of Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, HareHare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare
Hare is directly enacted from the spiritual platform, and thus thissound vibration surpasses all lower strata
of consciousness—namely sensual, mental, and intellectual. There isno need, therefore, to understand
the language of the mantra, nor is there any need for mentalspeculation or any intellectual adjustment
for chanting this maha-mantra. It springs automatically from thespiritual platform, and as such, anyone can
take part in the chanting without any previous qualification, anddance in ecstasy.
We have seen this practically. Even a child can take part in thechanting, or even a dog can take part in it.
Of course, for one who is too entangled in material life, it takesa little more time to come to the standard
point, but even such a materially engrossed man is raised to thespiritual platform very quickly. When the
mantra is chanted by a pure devotee of the Lord in love, it has thegreatest efficacy on the hearers, and as
such, this chanting should be heard from the lips of a pure devoteeof the Lord, so that immediate effects can
be achieved. As far as possible, chanting from the lips ofnondevotees should be avoided. Milk touched by the
lips of a serpent has poisonous effects.
The word Hara is the form of addressing the energy of the Lord, andthe words Krishna and Rama are forms
of addressing the Lord Himself. Both Krishna and Rama mean "thesupreme pleasure," and Hara is the
supreme pleasure energy of the Lord, changed to Hare in thevocative. The supreme pleasure energy of the
Lord helps us to reach the Lord.
The material energy, called maya, is also one of the multienergiesof the Lord. And we, the living entities, are
also the energy—marginal energy—of the Lord. The living entitiesare described as superior to material
energy. When the superior energy is in contact with the inferiorenergy, an incompatible situation arises; but
when the superior marginal energy is in contact with the superiorenergy, called Hara, the living entity
is established in his happy, normal condition.
These three words, namely Hare, Krishna, and Rama, are thetranscendental seeds of the maha-mantra. The
chanting is a spiritual call for the Lord and His internal energy,Hara, to give protection to the conditioned
soul. This chanting is exactly like the genuine cry of a child forits mother. Mother Hara helps the devotee
achieve the grace of the supreme father, Hari, or Krishna, and theLord reveals Himself to the devotee who
chants this mantra sincerely.
No other means of spiritual realization, therefore, is as effectivein this age as chanting the maha-mantra:
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama,Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

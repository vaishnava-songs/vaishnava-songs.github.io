Translation:
(1) The lotus feet of Lord Nityananda are a shelter whereone will get the soothing moonlight not only of one,
but of millions of moons. If the world wants to have real peace, itshould take shelter of Lord Nityananda.
Unless one takes shelter under the shade of the lotus feet of LordNityananda, it will be very difficult for him
to approach Radha-Krishna. If one actually wants to enter into thedancing party of Radha-Krishna, he must
firmly catch hold of the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda.
(2) Anyone who has not established his relationship withNityananda Prabhu is understood to have spoiled
his valuable human birth. Such a human being is actually anuncontrollable animal. Because he never uttered
the holy name of Nityananda, he has become merged into so-calledmaterial happiness. What can his
useless education and family tradition do to help him?
(3) Being maddened after false prestige and identificationwith the body, one is thinking, nOh, what
is Nityananda? What can He do for me? I don't care.î The result isthat he is accepting something false to be
truth. If you actually want to approach the association ofRadha-Krishna, you must first achieve the mercy of
Lord Nityananda. When He is merciful toward you, then you will beable to approach Radha-Krishna. Therefore
you should firmly grasp the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda.
(4) The lotus feet of Nityananda are not illusion; they area fact. One who engages in the transcendental
loving service of Nityananda is also transcendental. Always try tocatch the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda.
This Narottama dasa is very unhappy, therefore I am praying to LordNityananda to make me happy. My
dear Lord, please keep me close to Your lotus feet.

This is a very nice song sung by Narottama dasa Thakura. He advisesthat nitai-pada, the lotus feet of
Lord Nityananda (kamala means "lotus," and pada means "feet"), area shelter where one will get the
soothing moonlight not only of one, but of millions of moons. Wecan just imagine the aggregate total value of
the soothing shine of millions of moons. In this material world(jagat), which is progressing toward hell, there
is always a blazing fire, and everyone is struggling hard withoutfinding peace; therefore, if the world wants
to have real peace, it should take shelter under the lotus feet ofLord Nityananda, which are cooling like
the shining of a million moons. Juraya means "relief." If oneactually wants relief from the struggle of
existence and actually wants to extinguish the blazing fire ofmaterial pangs, Narottama dasa Thakura
advises, "Please take shelter of Lord Nityananda."
What will be the result of accepting the shelter of the lotus feetof Lord Nityananda? He says, heno nitai bine
bhai: unless one takes shelter under the shade of the lotus feet ofLord Nityananda, radha-krishna paite nai—it
will be very difficult for him to approach Radha-Krishna. The aimof this Krishna consciousness movement is
to enable us to approach Radha-Krishna and associate with theSupreme Lord in His sublime pleasure
dance. Narottama dasa Thakura advises that if one actually wants toenter into the dancing party of Radha-
Krishna, he must accept the shelter of the lotus feet of LordNityananda.
Then he says, se sambandha nahi Sambandha means "connection" or"contact." Anyone who has not contacted
a relationship with Nityananda is understood to have spoiled hishuman birth. In another song also,
Narottama dasa says, hari hari bifale janama gonainu: anyone whodoes not approach Radha-Krishna through
a relationship with Nityananda has uselessly spoiled his life.Britha means "useless," janma means "life," ta’r
means "his," and sambandha means "relationship." Anyone who doesnot make a relationship with Nityananda
is simply spoiling the boon of his human form of life. Why is hespoiling it? Sei pasu boro duracar. Sei
means "that," pasu means "animal," and duracar means "misbehaved"or "the most misbehaved."
Without elevation to Krishna consciousness through the mercy ofLord Caitanya and Nityananda, life is
simply spoiled in the animal propensities of sense gratification.Narottama dasa says that ordinary animals can
be tamed, but when a human being is animalistic, having only animalpropensities, he is most horrible, for
he cannot be tamed. Ordinary cats and dogs or even a tiger can betamed, but when a human being goes out of
his way and neglects to take to the human activity of Krishnaconsciousness, his higher intelligence will simply
be misused for animal propensities, and it is very difficult totame him. The enactment of state laws cannot make
a thief an honest man—because his heart is polluted, he cannot betamed. Every man sees that a person
who commits criminal offenses is punished by the government, andalso in scriptural injunctions punishment
in hell is mentioned. But despite hearing from scripture and seeingthe action of the state laws, the
demoniac cannot be tamed.
What are they doing? Nitai na bolilo mukhe. Since they do not knowwho Nityananda is, they never say the
names of Lord Nityananda and Lord Caitanya. Majilo samsara-sukhe.Majilo means "becomes absorbed."
They become absorbed in so-called material enjoyment. They don’tcare who Lord Caitanya and Nityananda
are, and therefore they go deep down into material existence.Vidya-kule ki koribe tar: if one has no
connection with Nityananda, and if he does not come to Krishnaconsciousness, his vidya, or his so-called
academic education, and kula, birth in a high family or greatnation, will not protect him. Regardless of
whether one is born in a very big family or nation or has a veryadvanced academic education, at the time of
death nature’s law will act, his work will be finished, and he willget another body according to that work.
Why are these human animals acting in this way? Ahankare mattahoiya, nitai-pada pasariya. They have
become maddened by a false concept of bodily life, and thus theyhave forgotten their eternal relationship
with Nityananda. Asatyere satya kori mani: such forgetful personsaccept the illusory energy as factual.
Asatyere refers to that which is not a fact, or, in other words,maya. Maya means that which has no existence but
is a temporary illusion only. Persons who have no contact withNityananda accept this illusory body as factual.
Narottama dasa Thakura then says, nitaiyer koruna habe, brajeradha-krishna pabe: "If you actually want
to approach the association of Radha-Krishna, you must achieve themercy of Lord Nityananda first. When He
is merciful toward you, then you will be able to approachRadha-Krishna." Dharo nitai-carana du’khani.
Narottama dasa advises that one firmly catch the lotus feet of LordNityananda.
Then again he says, nitai-carana satya. One should notmisunderstand and think that as he has caught hold
of maya, similarly the lotus feet of Nityananda may also besomething like that maya, or illusion.
Therefore Narottama dasa confirms, nitai-carana satya: the lotusfeet of Nityananda are not illusion; they are a
fact. Tahara sevaka nitya: and one who engages in thetranscendental loving service of Nityananda is
also transcendental. If one engages in the transcendental lovingservice of Nityananda in Krishna consciousness,
he immediately achieves his transcendental position on thespiritual platform, which is eternal and
blissful. Therefore he advises, nitai-pada sada koro asa: alwaystry to catch the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda.
Narottama boro dukhi. Narottama dasa Thakura, the acarya, is takingthe position that he is very
unhappy. Actually, he is representing ourselves. He says, "My dearLord, I am very unhappy." Nitai more
koro sukhi: "Therefore I am praying to Lord Nityananda to make mehappy." Rakho ranga-caranera pasa:
"Please keep me in a corner of Your lotus feet."

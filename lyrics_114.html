Lamentation Dueto Separation from the Lord and His Associates
(fromPrarthana)
(1)
je anilo prema-dhana korunapracur
heno prabhu kotha gelaacarya-thakur
(2)
kaha mora swarup rupa kahasanatan
kaha dasa raghunathapatita-pavan
(3)
kaha mora bhatta-juga kahakaviraj
eka-kale kotha gela goranata-raj
(4)
pashane kutibo matha analepasibo
gauranga gunera nidhi kotha gelepabo
(5)
se-saba sangira sange je koilobilas
se-sanga na paiya kande narottamadas

Translation:
(1) He who brought the treasure of divine love and who wasfilled with compassion and mercyâ€”where has such
a personality as Srinivasa Acarya gone?
(2) Where are my Svarupa Damodara and Rupa Gosvami? Where isSanatana? Where is Raghunatha dasa,
the savior of the fallen?
(3) Where are my Raghunatha Bhatta and Gopala Bhatta, andwhere is Krishnadasa Kaviraja? Where did
Lord Gauranga, the great dancer, suddenly go?
(4) I will smash my head against the rock and enter into thefire. Where will I find Lord Gauranga, the reservoir
of all wonderful qualities?
(5) Being unable to obtain the association of Lord Gaurangaaccompanied by all of these devotees in
whose association He performed His pastimes, Narottama dasa simplyweeps.

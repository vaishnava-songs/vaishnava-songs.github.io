TRANSLATION
Refrain: O beautiful one! O youthful boy who lives in myheart! Please come to me, O dark Syamal,
O delighter of my eyes!
1) The desire of my heart is to worship You intimately. Inthis hope, I humbly bow unto Your lotus feet.
2) O love of my eyes! Please take me with You! While I amsuffering in Your separation, the melody of
our impending meeting is the only thing that gives me anyhappiness. O monarch of my life! Why do
You remain silent and never speak to me? Tears are flowing from myeyes, and nothing in this world
gives me any satisfaction.
3) How much longer must I continue living in this condition?You are making me weep and cry out for
You, O darling Giridhari Lal! If I cannot attain You in thislifetime, then I shall just give up and
surrender myself unto death.

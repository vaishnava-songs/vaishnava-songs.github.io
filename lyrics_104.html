Translation:
1) Lord Nityananda is my wealth. Lord Gauracandra is mymaster. The Youthful Divine Couple is my
life. Advaita Acarya is my strength. Gadadhara is my family.narahari Sarakara is my glory.
2) The dust of the devotees' lotus feet is my bathing water.The chanting of the devotees names is my
satisfaction. Considering the merits of all Vedic literatures inthe light of devotional service, I have concluded
the the Srimad- Bhagavatam is the best of all scriptures.
3) My mind is firmly convinced of the spiritual benefitobtained by eating the remnants of foodstuff left by
the devotees. The names of the devotees are my happiness. The landof Vrndavana is the enclosure within
which I keep my mind. Poor-hearted Narottama dasa speaks in thisway.

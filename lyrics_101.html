(1)
nitai guna-mani amar nitaiguna-mani
aniya premer vanya bhasailoavani
(2)
premer vanya loiya nitai ailagauda-dese
dubilo bhakata-gana dina hinabhase
(3)
dina hina patita pamara nahibache
brahmar durlabha prema sabakarejace
(4)
abaddha karuna-sindhu nitai katiyamuhan
ghare ghare bule prema-amiyarban
(5)
locan bole mor nitai jeba nabhajilo
janiya suniya sei atma-ghatihoilo

Translation:
(1) My Lord Nityananda, the jewel of all virtues, my LordNityananda, the jewel of all virtues, has brought
the flood of ecstatic love of God that has drowned the entireworld.
(2) Bringing this overwhelming deluge of prema when Hereturned to Bengal from Jagannatha Puri on
Lord Caitanya’s order, Nitai has inundated the assembly ofdevotees. The fallen nondevotees did not
drown, however, but remained floating on that ecstatic ocean.
(3) Lord Nityananda freely offered this exalted prema, whichis difficult for Lord Brahma to attain, even to
the fallen and wretched souls who did not desire it.
(4) The ocean of mercy had formerly been sealed tight, butNitai cut a channel in its boundary to allow the
great flooding waves of nectarean prema to splash from house tohouse.
(5) Locana dasa says, “Whoever has not worshiped my Nitai ortaken advantage of this excellent
opportunity offered by Him knowingly commits suicide.”

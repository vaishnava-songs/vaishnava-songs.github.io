TRANSLATION
1) If Lord Gaura had not appeared as the yuga-avatara inthis age of Kali, then what would have
become of us? How could we have tolerated living? Who in thisuniverse would have ever learned
about the topmost limits of loving mellows that comprise the gloryof Sri Radha?
2) Who would have had the power to render ecstaticdevotional service that follows in the footsteps of
the damsels of Vraja? Indeed, the clever expertise of theVraja-gopis is a prerequisite for entering
the supremely sweet forest of Vrinda Devi.
3) Oh, please sing again and again of the glorious qualitiesof Lord Gauranga! Just try to keep your
heart simple. Not even one person within this ocean of nesciencehas ever seen such a
magnanimous personality as He.
4) Even though I chant the holy name of Lord Gauranga,somehow I still have not melted in ecstasy—
how then have I maintained the burden of this body? How has theCreator fashioned this body with a
stone in place of Vasudeva Ghosh’s heart?

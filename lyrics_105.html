Translation:
(1) 0 Vaishnava Gosvami, please be merciful to me now. Thereis no one except you who can purify the fallen souls.
(2) Where does anyone find such a merciful personality bywhose mere audience all sins go far away?
(3) After bathing in the waters of the sacred Ganges manytimes, one becomes purified, but just by the sight
of you, the fallen souls are purified. This is your greatpower.
(4) The holy name delivers one who has committed an offenseto Lord Hari, but if one commits an offense to
you, there is no means of deliverance.
(5) Your heart is always the resting place of Lord Govinda,and Lord Govinda says, "The Vaishnavas are in
My heart."
(6) I desire the dust of your holy feet in every birth I maytake. Please consider Narottama yours, and be
kind upon him.

rāj-rāṇī mīrābhikhāriṇī
giridhāri tomārolāgiyā

kāńdaiyo nāabhāgire
rākho more ańge miśayago
(4)
giridhāri tomāro prāṇmirār
giridhāri tomārolāgiyā

TRANSLATION
Refrain: The queen Mira is simply a beggar-woman, but onlyfor Your sake, O Giridhari!
1) I simply wander here and there like a mendicant, but Iseek only the alms of Your holy name.
2) People say, “Mira has become a madwoman.” The King says,“She has disgraced her family.” But
Mira says, “O Lord Giridhari, my only desire is to remain at Yourlotus feet.”
3) O Prabhuji! Kindly reveal Yourself to me! Mira simplyweeps for You, my Lord. Please don’t make
this most unfortunate person cry any more. Please keep me tightlyembraced, as if united with Your
own body.
4) O Giridhari! You are the life and soul of Mira!

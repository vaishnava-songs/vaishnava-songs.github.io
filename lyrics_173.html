TRANSLATION
1) O Lord, completely forgetting You, I have offered my mindunto the society of women, children,
and friends—but this experience has been just like offering a dropof water unto the burning hot sands
of the beach. How can I possibly be relieved of this greatmisery?
2) O Madhava! As a consequence, I am rendered totallydespondent. You are the savior of the
universe, and are merciful to the helpless souls. Therefore, Iplace my hope only in You.
3) Wandering about in a half-alive condition, I spent mylife in utter disgrace. Uncountable days passed
as a frivolous child and a useless old man. I have been intoxicatedby the pleasure of sharing
romantic adventures with beautiful young women. When will I everget a chance to worship You?
4) Numberless Brahmas have died one after another, whereasYou are without beginning or end. All
of them take birth from You and are again absorbed in You, justlike the waves in the ocean.
5) Vidyapati confesses than now, at the end of his life, heis fearful of death. O Lord! There is no
shelter other than You. You will always remain celebrated as beingthe Lord of both beginning and
the beginningless. Now the responsibility for my deliverance fromthe material world is entirely Yours.

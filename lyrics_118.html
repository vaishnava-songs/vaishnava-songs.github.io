Translation:
(1) The divine couple, Sri Sri Radha and Krishna, are mylife and soul. In life or death I have no other refuge
but Them.
(2) In a forest of small kadamba trees on the bank of theYamuna, I will seat the divine couple on a throne made
of brilliant jewels.
(3) I will anoint Their dark and fair forms with sandalwoodpaste scented with cuya, and I will fan Them with
a camara whisk. Oh, when will I behold Their moonlike faces?
(4) After stringing together garlands of malati flowers Iwill place them around Their necks, and I will
offer tambula scented with camphor to Their lotus mouths.
(5) With the permission of all the sakhis, headed by Lalitaand Visakha, I will serve the lotus feet of Radha
and Krishna.
(6) Narottama dasa, the servant of the servant of SriKrishna Caitanya Prabhu, longs for this service to the
divine couple.

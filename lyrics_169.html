Translation :
(1) Sometimes in great happiness Lord Jagannatha makes aloud concert with His flute in the groves on the
banks of the Yamuna. He is like a bumblebee tasting the beautifullotuslike faces of the cowherd damsels of
Vraja, and great personalities such as Lakshmi, Siva, Brahma,Indra, and Ganesa worship His lotus feet. May
that Jagannatha Svami be the object of my vision.
(2) In His left hand Lord Jagannatha holds a flute, on Hishead He wears peacock feathers, and on His hips
He wears fine yellow silken cloth. From the corners of His eyes Hebestows sidelong glances upon His
loving devotees, and He always reveals Himself through His pastimesin His divine abode of Vrindavana. May
that Jagannatha Svami be the object of my vision.
(3) On the shore of the great ocean, within a large palaceatop the brilliant, golden Nilacala Hill, Lord
Jagannatha resides with His powerful brother Balabhadra and Hissister Subhadra, who sits between Them.
May that Jagannatha Svami, who bestows the opportunity fordevotional service upon all godly souls, be the
object of my vision.
(4) Lord Jagannatha is an ocean of mercy and as beautiful asa row of blackish rain clouds. He is the storehouse
of bliss for Lakshmi and Sarasvati, and His face resembles aspotless fullblown lotus. The best of demigods and
sages worship Him, and the Upanishads sing His glories. May thatJagannatha Svami be the object of my vision.
(5) When Lord Jagannatha moves along the road on HisRathayatra car, at every step large assemblies
of brahmanas loudly chant prayers and sing songs for His pleasure.Hearing their hymns, Lord
Jagannatha becomes very favorably disposed toward them. He is theocean of mercy and the true friend of all
the worlds. May that Jagannatha Svami, along with His consortLakshmi, who was born from the ocean of nectar,
be the object of my vision.
(6) Lord Jagannatha, whose eyes resemble full-blown lotuspetals, is the ornament on Lord Brahma's head.
He resides on Nilacala Hill with His lotus feet placed on the headsof Anantadeva. Overwhelmed by the mellows
of love, He joyfully embraces Srimati Radharani's body, which islike a cool pond. May that Jagannatha Svami
be the object of my vision.
(7) I do not pray for a kingdom? nor for gold, rubies, orwealth. I do not ask for a beautiful wife. as desired by
all men. I simply pray that Jagannatha Svami, whose glories LordSiva always sings, may be the constant object
of my vision.
(8) 0 Lord of the demigods, please quickly remove thisuseless material existence I am undergoing. O Lord of
the Yadus, please destroy this vast, shoreless ocean of sins. Alas,this is certain: Lord Jagannatha bestows His
lotus feet upon those who feel themselves fallen and have noshelter in this world but Him. May that
Jagannatha Svami be the object of my vision.
The self-retrained, virtuous soul who recites these eight versesglorifying Lord Jagannatha becomes cleansed of
all sins and duly proceeds to Lord Vishnu's abode.

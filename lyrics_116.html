TRANSLATION
1) Vrndavana is filled withblossoming flowers, the dancing of peacocks and the sounds ofcuckoos
and bumble-bees. When, in the association of the dear gopis, will Imelodiously sing in a charming
cottage in a grove of Vrndavana?
2) When, seeing the slowlyand gracefully moving Divine Couple, will my hairs stand on endbecause of
the ecstasy in my heart?
3) When, in the company ofthe gopis, will Srimati Radharani gesture that she wants me to combher
hair, and when will I then take the comb in my hand, and carefullycomb her curling locks?
4) When will I anointSrimati Radharani's limbs with sandalwood paste and musk? When willI give
her beautiful garlands? When will I gaze on her moonlike face as Idecorate it with tilaka
markings drawn in sandalwood paste and kunkuma?
5) When will I carefullydress Srimati Radharani in blue garments? When will I placejewelled anklets
on her feet? When will I take water from a jar and wash her reddishlotus feet? When will I then dry
her feet using my own hair as a towel?
6) When will I make a couchof lotus petals for the Divine Couple? When will I gently fan Themwith
a white camara whisk?
7) When from a golden boxwill I take betel-nuts and camphor, and place them in the lotusmouths of
the Divine Couple? When will I carefully chew the aromatic remnantsof such betel-nuts, which
have become mixed with nectar from mouths of the Divine Couple?
8) O Lokanatha Gosvami, Omy spiritual master, O friend of the poor and wretched conditionedsouls,
O ocean of mercy, please hear the appeal of this person who is verymiserable and poor-hearted. O
Radha and Krsna, O holy land of Vrndavana, O intimate gopi-friendsof the Divine Couple, I beg that you
all grant this charity to me. Please fulfil these desires.

TRANSLATION
Refrain: All obeisances to You, O Ghana-syam!
1) Taking refuge at Your lotus feet, I fearlessly imploreYou – this time, O Hari, give me Your mercy! I shall cross theocean of sorrow by the boat of Your holy name.
2) O Lord, we are always asleep, while You are ever awake.Every moment we can only make errors, our eyes being covered byillusion.
3) Please remove this covering, my Lord, so I may beholdYour form as the Divine Couple, with Sri Radha by Your side. I willgaze at You until my hankering eyes are pacified, thus fulfillingmy soul’s desire. O Ghana-syam! I offer this prayer unto You!

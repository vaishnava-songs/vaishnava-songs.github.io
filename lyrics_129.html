TRANSLATION
Refrain: O Lord Sri Krsna! I am offering a prayer unto You.Please let the bee of my mind be offered the nectarian honey ofYour lotus feet.
1) Although Brahma in full samadhi cannot catch a glimpse ofeven a ray of the effulgence from the tips of Your toe-nails still,O Acyutah! Having heard of the waves of Your astonishing mercy, Ilong to receive Your grace.
2) O Madhava! Although I don't possess even a sesame seed ofbhakti for You, still, by Your inconceivable power which makes theimpossible possible, please fulfill the desires of my heart.
3) He Sanatana! Because Your lotus feet are filled with suchwonderful rasa, let the bee of my mind always reside unwaveringlyin that nectar which puts everything else to shame, for they arethe essence of all sweetness. This is my only prayer.

(1)
avatara sar gaura avatara kena na bhajili tare
kari nire vas gela na piyasa apana karama phere
(2)
kantakeru taru sadayi sevili man, amrta payivarase
prema kalpataru sri gauranga amar tahare bhavilivise
(3)
saurabher ase palasa sunkili man, nasate pasile kita
ikshudanda bhavi katha chusili man, kemane paeebi mitha
(4)
har baliya galaya parili man, saman kinkar sapa
sital baliya aguna pohali man, paii vajar tapa
(5)
samsar bhajili sri gauranga bhulili, na sunili sadhura katha
iha parakala dukala khoyali man, khayili apana matha

TRANSLATION
1) O my mind, why don’t you worship Sri Gaurasundara, thecrown-jewel of all incarnations? You always stay
in water but your thirst is never satiated due to your own past badactivities.
2) You always hope to attain sweet, juicy fruits from yourworship of thorn trees, but this is not possible.
Our Gaurasundara is a desire-tree offering divine love, but youleft Him, thinking Him to be poison.
3) O my mind, searching for some sweet aroma, you smell thebeautiful palasa flower
(but it has no scent), and instead, an insect from the flowerenters your nose. You suck on dry wood, mistaking it
for sugar cane, so how can you get any sweet juice?
4) O my mind, death is like snake which you put around yourneck, thinking it to be a garland. You entered
fire, thinking it to be cool, and suffered excruciatingburning.
5) O my mind, enjoyingmaterial pleasures, you never heeded the devotees’ words and
forgot Gaurasundara. Thus, both this world and the next are lost toyou.

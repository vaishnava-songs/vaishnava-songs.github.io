Translation:
1) O my dear Lord Gauranga! Please show Your mercy to thislowly and destitute soul. O Lord! There is no
one more fallen than myself in all the three worlds.
2) Holding grass between my teeth, O Lord Gaura, I amcalling out to You now! Please be compassionate upon
me and come to reside within the temple of my heart.
3) If You do not give Your mercy, seeing how fallen I am,then why are You known as Patita Pavana—the
merciful Savior of the fallen?
4) I am plunged amidst the violent hurricane-stricken wavesin the ocean of this material world, from which
there is no escape. Kindly give me the gift of Your divine lotusfeet, which are compared to a boat in which
Your servant may cross over the ocean of birth and death.
5) Narottama Dasa, the servant of the servant of Sri KrishnaCaitanya Prabhu, ceaselessly makes this prayer.

Translation:
(1) 0 Lord Hari, I have spent my life uselessly. Havingobtained a human birth and having not worshiped
Radha and Krishna, I have knowingly drunk poison.
(2) The treasure of divine love in Goloka Vrindavana hasdescended as the congregational chanting of Lord
Hari’s holy names. Why did my attraction for that chanting nevercome about? Day and night my heart burns
from the fire of the poison of worldliness, and I have not takenthe means to relieve it.
(3) Lord Krishna, who is the son of the King of Vraja,became the son of Saci (Lord Caitanya), and Balarama
became Nitai. The holy name delivered all those souls who werelowly and wretched. The two sinners Jagai
and Madhai are evidence of this.
(4) 0 Lord Krishna, son of Nanda, accompanied by thedaughter of Vrishabhanu, please be merciful to me
now. Narottama dasa says, "O Lord, please do not push me away fromYour reddish lotus feet, for who is
my beloved except for You?"

parama koruna, pahu duijana
nitai gauracandra
saba avatara-sarasiromani

bhajo bhajo bhai, caitanyanitai
sudridha biswasakori
vishaya chadiya, se rasemajiya,
mukhe bolo harihari

dekho ore bhai, tri-bhuvanenai,
emona doyala data
pasu pakhi jhure, pashanavidare,

apana karama, bhunjayesamana,

Translation:
(1) The two Lords, Nitai-Gauracandra, are very merciful.They are the essence of all incarnations. The
specific significance of these incarnations is that They introduceda process of chanting and dancing that is
simply joyful.
(2) My dear brother, I request that you just worship LordCaitanya and Nityananda with firm conviction and
faith. If one wants to be Krishna conscious by this process, onehas to give up his engagement in sense
gratification. One simply has to chant, "Hare Krishna! Hari Hari!"without any motive.
(3) My dear brother, just try and examine this. Within thethree worlds there is no one like Lord Caitanya or
Lord Nityananda. Their merciful qualities are so great that uponhearing them even birds and beasts cry and
stones melt.
(4) But Locana dasa regrets that I am entrapped by sensegratification. Since I have no attraction for the lotus
feet of Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityananda, then Yamaraja, thesuperintendent of death, is punishing me by
not allowing me to be attracted by this movement.

This is a song by Locana dasa Thakura. Pahu means "Lord," and duijana means "two." Locana dasa
Thakura declares that the two Lords, Nitai-Gauracandra—Lord Nitaiand Lord Caitanya—are very
merciful (parama koruna). Saba avatara-sara siromani. Avatara means"incarnation," and saba means "all."
They are the essence of all incarnationself-realization is simplyjoyful (kevala ananda-kanda), for They
introduced chanting and dancing. There are many incarnations, likeLord Rama and even Krishna, who
taught Bhagavad-gita, which requires knowledge and understanding.But Lord Caitanya and
Nityananda introduced a process that is simply joyful—simply chantand dance. Therefore, Locana dasa
requests everyone, bhajo bhajo bhai, caitanya-nitai: "My dearbrother, I request that you just worship
Lord Caitanya and Nityananda with firm conviction and faith." Don’tthink that this chanting and dancing will
not lead to the desired goal. It will. It is the assurance of LordCaitanya Mahaprabhu that one will get all
perfection by this process. Therefore one must chant with firmfaith and conviction (biswasa kori’).
But what is the process? The process is vishaya chariya, se rasemajiya. If one wants to be Krishna conscious by
this process, one has to give up his engagement in sensegratification. That is the only restriction. If one gives
up sense gratification, it is sure that he will reach the desiredgoal. Mukhe bolo hari hari: one simply has to
chant, "Hare Krishna! Hari Hari!" without any motive of sensegratification.
Dekho ore bhai, tri-bhuvane nai. Locana dasa Thakura says, "My dearbrother, you just try and examine
this. Within the three worlds there is no one like Lord Caitanya orLord Nityananda, because Their
merciful qualities are so great that They make even birds andbeasts cry, what to speak of human beings."
Actually, when Lord Caitanya passed through the forest known asJharikhanda, the tigers, elephants, snakes,
deer, and all other animals joined Him in chanting Hare Krishna: Itis so nice that anyone can join. Even the
animals can join, what to speak of human beings. Of course, it isnot possible for ordinary men to induce
animals to chant, but if Caitanya Mahaprabhu could inspire animalsto chant, at least we can encourage
human beings to adopt this path of Hare Krishna mantra chanting. Itis so nice that even the most stonehearted
man will be melted. Pashana means "stone." It is so nice that evenstone will melt.
But Locana dasa Thakura regrets that he is entrapped by sensegratification. He addresses himself, "My dear
mind, you are entrapped in this sense gratification process, andyou have no attraction for chanting Hare
Krishna. Since you have no attraction for the lotus feet of LordCaitanya and Lord Nityananda, what can I say? I
can simply think of my misfortune. Yamaraja, the superintendent ofdeath, is punishing me by not allowing me
to be attracted by this movement."s. The specific significance ofthese incarnations is that prosecuting Their

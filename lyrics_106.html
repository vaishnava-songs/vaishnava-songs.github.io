Gaura Pahu

gaura pahu na bhajiyamainu
prema-ratana-dhana helayaharainu
(2)
adhane jatana kori dhanateyaginu
apana karama-dose apanidubinu
(3)
sat-sanga chadi’ kainu asatevilasa
te-karane lagilo yekarma-bandha-phans
(4)
visaya-visama-visa satatakhainu
gaura-kirtana-rase maghana nahainu
(5)
keno va achaye prana ki sukhapaiya
narottam das keno na gelomariya

Translation:
1) I did not consider worshiping Lord Gauranga, but insteadbrought about my spiritual ruin by neglecting that
treasure trove of pure of God.
2) I gave up the association of the saintly devotees toenjoy myself in the company of the ungodly. Therefore I
am bound up by the snare of karma.
3) I am always drinking the dangerous poison of sensegratification, thus I can never absorb myself in the
blissful nectar of chanting the glories of Lord Caitanya.
4) Why am I still living and what happiness do I have?Narottama dasa says, "Why have I not died long ago?"
This is not only Narottama dasa Thakura’s lamentation. If I cannotcome in touch with Lord Caitanya and
His associates, it would be better for me to die.

This is a song by Narottama dasa Thakura. He says, gaura pahu nabhajiya mainu: “I have invited my spiritual
death by not worshiping Lord Caitanya.” Gaura pahu means “LordCaitanya,” and na bhajiya, “without
worshiping.” Mainu: “I have invited spiritual death.” And why haveI invited spiritual death? Adhane jatane kari
dhana teyaginu: “Because I am engaged in something which is uselessand have rejected the real purpose of my
life. Adhane means “valueless things,” and dhana means “valuables.”So actually every one of us is neglecting
our spiritual emanicipation: we are engaged in material sensegratification, and therefore we are losing the
opportunity of this human form of body to elevate ourselves to thespiritual platform. This human body is
especially provided to the conditioned soul to give him a chancefor spiritual emancipation. So anyone who does
not care for spiritual emancipation is inviting spiritual death.Spiritual death means to forget oneself—to forget
that one is spirit. That is spiritual death, like animal life.Animal life is full forgetfulness. The animals cannot
be reminded under any circumstances that they are not this body. Itis only in this human form of life that one
can understand that he is not this body, that he is spirit soul. Bychanting Hare Krishna one can easily understand
this fact. In other words, by worshiping Lord Caitanya, followingHis principles and ways, and chanting Hare
Krishna one can very easily come to the platform of spiritualunderstanding.
But Narottama dasa Thakura says on our behalf that we areneglecting this. Therefore we are inviting spiritual
death. Then he says, prema-ratana-dhana helaya harainu. Spirituallife means to develop real love. Everyone
says “love.” There are so many signboards, so many books: “Love,love.” But there is no love. This is illusion. It is
all lust. “Love” for intoxication, “love” for sex, “love” for thisand that. This is going on. Actually, the word love
is applicable only with Krishna, with God: To love means to loveKrishna. That is spiritual love. And we are
created for that purpose. So, that is wanted. Narottama dasa says,“I could have achieved that transcendental
treasure of love, but I was robbed of it because of neglecting toworship Lord Caitanya.” And why has this
happened? Apana karama-dose apani dubinu: “Due to my pastmisdeeds.” Due to our past misdeeds, we get a
certain type of body. Everyone who has got a material body hasreceived it due to his past misdeeds, and even his
past pious deeds. Actually, as long as one gets a material body,there are no pious deeds. “Pious deeds” means no
more material body. Otherwise, it is to be taken as a fact thateven Brahma, who is the chief living entity within
this universe and has a long, long duration of life and so muchpower—still, he is considered to have
performed misdeeds because he has a material body. So, by ourmisdeeds we go down and down, getting one
body after another. In Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that peopledo not know that by engaging in sense
gratification they are assuring that they will have another body.And the body is the cause of material pangs. It is
only because I have this body that I feel a headache, astomachache, etc. But as soon as we are out of this
material body, there are no more material pangs. It is simplyjoyful life. Brahma-bhuta prasannatma.
Prasannatma means “joyful.” But due to our past misdeeds we aremissing this opportunity.
And why is it happening? Sat-sannga chadi’ kainu asate vilasa: “Ihave given up the association of devotees and
am associating with common nonsense men for sense gratification.”Sat means “spirit,” and asat means
“matter.” Association with nondevotees produces materialattachment, and that means implication in
material, conditioned life. So, one has to associate with devotees.Sata prasaigan mama virya-saivido. One can
learn about God only in the association of devotees. Therefore weare pushing this Krishna consciousness
society. You’ll find that one who comes to this society andassociates with us for a few days or a few weeks
becomes Krishna conscious, and soon he comes forward for initiationand further advancement. So, association
with devotees is very important. But here Narottama dasa Thakuralaments, sat-sanga chadi kainu asatye vilasa
te-karane lagilo ye karma-bandha-phans: “I have given up tand triedto enjoy among nondevotees, and
immediately maya has caught me and mangled me in the web offruitive activities.” May is just by our side. As soon
as we give up the company of devotees, maya says, “Yes, come to mycompany.” Nobody can remain without
any company; that is not possible. One must associate with eithermaya or Krishna. And when we speak of
Krishna, we mean Krishna and His devotees. Krishna is never alone.He is always with Radharani, with the
other gopis, with the cowherd boys. So to be Krishna consciousmeans to keep association with the devotees
of Krishna.
Next Narottama dasa Thakura says, visaya-visama-visa satata khainu:“I have always drunk the most dangerous
poison of sense gratification.” Visaya means “sense gratification.”Eating, sleeping. mating, and defending—these
four principles are called visaya. And viasama means “dangerous.”And visa means “poison.” If one is simply
engaged with these four activities, just like the animals, then oneis simply drinking poison. That’s all. “I know this
is poison, but I am so much intoxicated that I am drinking thispoison at every moment.” Then, gaura-kirtanarase
maghana na hainu: “Therefore I could not merge myself into thesankirtana movement of Lord Caitanya.” That
is actually the fact. Those who are too much attached to thematerialistic way of life, who are always drinking
the poison of sense gratification, are not attracted by thesankirtana movement.
Finally Narottama dasa Thakura, representing ourselves, laments,keno va achaye pran ki sukha paiya: “Why am
I living? I have not associated with the devotees, I have not takenpart in the sankirtana movement, I do not
understand what is Krishna, I do not understand what is LordCaitanya. Then why am I living? What is my
happiness? Why did I not die long, long ago?” So. this is not onlyNarottama dasa Thakura’s lamentation. Every
one of us should think like that: “If I cannot associate withdevotees, if I cannot understand the Krishna
consciousness movement, if I cannot come in touch with LordCaitanya and His associates, it would be better for me
to die.” This is the substance of this the association ofdevotees.

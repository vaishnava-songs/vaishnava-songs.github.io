Ki Rupe PaibaSeba
(1)
ki-rupe paiba seba muiduracara
sri-guru-vaisnabe rati na hailaamara
(2)
asesa mayate mana maganahaila
vaisnabete lesa-matra rati najanmila
(3)
bisaye tuliya andha hainudiba-nisi
gale phamsa dite phire maya sepisaci
(4)
inhare kariya jaya chadana najaya
sadhu-krpa bina ara hanikaupaya
(5)
adosada-rasi-prabhupatita-uddhara
ei-bara narottame karahanistara

Translation:
1) I have no devotion for either the Vaisnavas or my ownspiritual master. How is it possible for a rascal like
me to attain devotional service?
2) My mind is always drowning in illusion. I have not eventhe smallest fragment of devotion for the Vaisnavas.
3) I have become blind by constantly meditating on theobjects of the senses. The maya-witch has placed
a hangman's noose around my neck.
4) Even if I can cure my blindness and defeat themaya-hangman, I cannot become free from material
illusion without the mercy of the saintly devotees.
5) O master, O purifier of the sinful, O savior of thefallen souls, please rescue this Narottama dasa.

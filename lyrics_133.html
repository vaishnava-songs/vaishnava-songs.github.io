TRANSLATION
1) His complexion is the hue of fresh cream tinged withkunkum. He is the ever-fresh Cupid who shoots arrows
of newly blossoming flowers. He bears newer and newer moods ofemotional ecstasies. He is fond of performing
novel dances. He makes ever-new jokes that cause much laughter. Hisbrilliant luster is like freshly cast gold. I
bow down to Gaura, the beautiful son of Mother Saci.
2) He is endowed with ever-fresh love of Godhead. Hisradiant luster is like the color of fresh butter. His freshattire
is arranged in evernew fashions. He relishes ever-new mellows oflove for Krsna. He shines in nine-fold new
ways while executing the nine-fold processes of devotion. He ispermeated with a most auspicious loving nature. I
bow down to Gaura, the beautiful son of Mother Saci.
3) He is absorbed in devotion to Sri Hari. He maintains thechanting of the names of Hari. While chanting He
counts the holy names on the fingers of His hands. He is addictedto the name of Hari. He always has tears of
love welling in His eyes. I bow down to Gaura, the beautiful son ofMother Saci.
4) He is always removing the suffering of material existencefor mankind. He is the goal of life for persons who
are dedicated to their supreme interest. He inspires men to becomelike honeybees (eager for the honey of
Krsna-prema). He removes the burning fever of the material world. Ibow down to Gaura, the beautiful son of
Mother Saci.
5) He who motivates pure devotion unto Himself, who is mostattractive to His beloved servitors. By His
dramatic dancing He exhibits the characteristics of the King ofparamours. He causes the minds of beautiful
young village women to dance. I bow down to Gaura, the beautifulson of Mother Saci.
6) He plays karatals as His throat emits sweet melodioussounds and the vibrant notes of the vina are softly played.
He thus inspires the devotees to perform dramatic dancing that isinfused with aspects of His own devotional service.
I bow down to Gaura, the beautiful son of Mother Saci.
7) He is accompanied by the sankirtana movement, which isthe religious practice for the age of Kali. He is the son
of Nanda Maharaja come again. He is the extraordinarily brilliantornament of the earth. His preaching mood
is suitably adapted to the cycle of birth and death. Hisconsciousness is fixed in meditation on His own form of
Krsna. He is always accompanied by His transcendental abode. I bowto Gaura, the beautiful son of Mother Saci.
8) His eyes, the soles of His feet, and His clothing arereddish like the color that heralds the rising sun. As He
utters His own names, His voice falters. He awakens a sweet flavorto life throughout the universe. I bow down
to Gaura, the beautiful son of Mother Saci.

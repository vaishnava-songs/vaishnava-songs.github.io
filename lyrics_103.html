Translation:
1) O brother, please worship the lotus feet of LordGauranga. I have not worshipped them, but instead have
dived into the poisonous well of materialistic household-life, andas a result my five life-airs are burning with
the poison of material life.
2) Day and night I burn in the poisonous fire of thethreeforld miseries of material life, and as a result I
repeatedly faint. mys senses are overwhelmed by lust, agreed, andnumberless other enemies, and I am averse
to the great treasure which is the lotus feet of Lord Gauranga.
3) O brother, give up all fear and shyness, and take shelterof merciful Lord Gauranga. Lord Gauranga
rescues those who are most wicked at heart, and therefore He isknown as Patita-pavana, the savior of the fallen.
4) If you place Lord Gauranga, the brahmana king of dancers,within your heart, then what will death be able
to do to you? Narottama dasa says: There is no one equal to LordGauranga. Even if one will not become
His devotee, still Lord Gauranga will freely give him the treasureof love of Krsna.

Translation:
1) I offer my respectful obeisances to the beautiful son ofSri Sacidevi. His superexcellent spiritual body is a
brilliant golden colour. He is incessantly churned by sublimetranscendental ecstasies. A tiny fraction of His
mercy is able to deliver all the three worlds.
2) I offer my respectful obeisances to the beautiful son ofSri Sacidevi. His transcendental form
manifests transformations of ecstasy such as faltering of thevoice. The mighty sound of His voice chastises
wicked men. His mercy dispels the fear of all that causes repeatedbirth and death.
3) I offer my respectful obeisances to the beautiful son ofSri Sacidevi. He wears garments the colour of the rays of
the rising sun. The radiance of his beautiful cheeks and nails putsto shame the moon. He takes delight in
uttering the glories of His own transcendental qualities and holyname.
4) I offer my respectful obeisances to the beautiful son ofSri Sacidevi. Streams of ecstatic tears flow from His
lotus eyes. He is ornamented with transformations of ecstasy causedby ever-new loving mellows. His pastimes
of dancing exhibit very slow and graceful movements.
5) I offer my respectful obeisances to the beautiful son ofSri Sacidevi. The nimble movements of His
beautiful dancing feet, adorned by sweetly twinkling anklets, arevery pleasing. His soothing brilliant
face surpasses the cooling rays of the moon.
6) I offer my respectful obeisances to the beautiful son ofSri Sacidevi. His wonderful divine form is graced by
a shaven head and adorned with the loincloth of a mendicant, thesannyasa staff and waterpot. Such a form of
His chastises wicked souls and destroys their sins.
7) I offer my respectful obeisances to the beautiful son ofSri Sacidevi. As a householder, His face is surrounded
by locks of dark hair, decorated with the dust of the earth. Hisexcellent lips, which are red like the bimba
fruit, are beautified by their trembling in ecstasy. Upon Hisforehead He wears brilliant tilak made of
sandalwood paste.
8) I offer my respectful obeisances to the beautiful son ofSri Sacidevi. The glowing beauty of His lotus-petal
eyes surpasses that of the rising sun. His two splendid arms extenddown to His knees. His divine body is
dressed in the fashion of an adolescent dancer.

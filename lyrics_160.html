mirār prabhu, esogiridhāri

abhāginī mirār, minotirākho
bhulo bhuloabhimān
śyāmol, sundaraśyām

TRANSLATION
(Refrain): The beautiful Syama is the Lord of Mirabai.Please come to me, Giridhari!
1) My heart, which is like the Jamuna River is restricted byits two banks, is now overflowing with
divine love for You.
2) The kadamba tree of my mind is blooming with flowers thatsway to and fro on the waves ofdivine
love.O Hari, please come and play Your flute. You are the life andsoul of Sri Radhika.
3) Mirabai says, “For Your sake, O Syama, I gave up my home,and I have also given up my own family.
In the same way that the gopis of Vraja cried out of separationfrom You, I also cry as
Your loving devotee. Please keep this prayer of Your mostunfortunate Mira at Your lotus feet and
disregard my false pride.

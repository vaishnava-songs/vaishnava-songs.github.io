TRANSLATION
1) His lotus feet are served in devotion by multitudes ofhigh, virtuous souls; he is the establisher of the religion of theage (as Sri Krsna-sankirtana); he is the presiding monarch (of theVisva Vaisnava-Raja-Sabha - the universal society of the puredevotees that are the true 'kings' or guides of all); and he is thefulfiller of the most cherished desires of those who dispel fear(for all souls). I make my obeisance unto the lotus feet of thatillustrious great soul, worshippable by one and all - perpetuallydo I make my obeisance unto the radiance emanating from thetoenails of the holy feet of my Lord.
2) He is the leader of the fortunate souls blessed with thetreasure of internal pure devotion; he is greatly merciful upon thefallen souls, being their only shelter; and his inconceivable holyfeet are the shelter for the deceivers, by deceiving them. I makemy obeisance unto his lotus feet - perpetually do I make myobeisance unto the radiance emanating from the toenails of the holyfeet of my Lord.
3) I make my obeisance unto his divine, charming yetcommanding lofty form of golden hue. That beautiful figure shamesthe mad ecstasy of golden lotus stems. Venerated by tens ofmillions of Cupids, the moons of the toenails of my WorshipfulDivine Master reveal the beauty of his lotus feet. Perpetually do Imake my obeisance unto that effulgence emanating from the toenailsof the holy feet of my Lord.

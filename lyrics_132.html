TRANSLATION
1) Roaring like a lion and thundering like a monsoon cloud,He prays day and night, "O Krishna, O Lord
of Radhika!" He smears the Salagrama-sila with the paste ofsandalwood and musk and offers arati
with incense and lamp. I meditate upon the lotus feet of SriAdvaitacarya, the Lord of Sitadevi.
2) He worships the Salagrama-sila with water of the Gangamixed with Tulasi manjaris and leaves. Tears
of love incessently flow from His eyes as He meditates upon Krishnaand sings His glories. He prays to
the Supreme Lord, who is an ocean of mercy, to descend to thisworld. I meditate upon the lotus feet of
Sri Advaitacarya, the Lord of Sitadevi.
3) Again and again He loudly sings the name of Krishna,praying to Him, "O my Lord, deliverer of
the universe, please manifest Your exceedingly merciful two-armedform in my vision. Please award me
the proper vision." I meditate upon the lotus feet of SriAdvaitacarya, the Lord of Sitadevi.
4) Due to the prayers of Sri Advaitacarya, Sri Caitanyaappeared in the house of Jagannatha Misra in
the womb of Mother Saci. In order to enjoy the association of SriAdvaita, Sri Caitanya sang the Holy
Name of the Lord congregationally and danced with the devotees. Imeditate upon the lotus feet of
Sri Advaitacarya, the Lord of Sitadevi.
5) The lotus feet of Sri Advaita are the goal of myknowledge and the object of my meditation. I
always keep the dust of His lotus feet on my head. O my Lord,please bestow devotional service upon
this unworthy soul and protect him. I meditate upon the lotus feetof Sri Advaitacarya, the Lord of Sitadevi.
6) Sri Advaita, the Lord of Sitadevi, is the bestower of allbenedictions and perfections, and He is the
Lord of my life. That most merciful Lord immediately bestows bhaktiupon those who meditate
exclusively upon his lotus feet. I meditate upon the lotus feet ofSri Advaitacarya, the Lord of Sitadevi.
7) All glories to Sri Advaita along with Sri Caitanya andthe most merciful Nityananda Prabhu. They are
all One, but in three different forms, depicting the differentphases of life, like adolescence, etc. Sri
Advaita roars and thunders in order to deliver the living entitiesby giving them transcendental
knowledge and pure devotional service. I meditate upon the lotusfeet of Sri Advaitacarya, the Lord
of Sitadevi.
8) He bestows loving devotional service upon the lowly,mean, blasphemous and other such fallen
people. The bestower of everything, Sri Advaita, the Lord ofSitadevi, is the leader of Santipura. He
frees one from the bondage of material attachments, badassociation, fruitive activities and mystic yoga.
I meditate upon the lotus feet of Sri Advaitacarya, the Lord ofSitadevi.
